      <h2>What is "The PKFR Spot"?</h2>
      <p class="mat-body">
        We aim to be the spot for all PKFR things. We are integrating lots of
        different features and capabilities into this website to make it a great
        tool for freerunners and traceurs. We want to provide a hub to let
        freerunners share media, scout locations, plan sessions and grow as a
        community.

      <h4>Is there a catch?</h4>
      <p class="mat-body">
        Well, we are running ads. But we are planning to collaborate with
        parkour brands and gyms to only show you relevant PKFR-related ads.
      </p>
      <p class="mat-body">
        Also, maybe we will be accepting donations in the future for future
        projects, like an app, for example.
